# Setup and Lambda Code

In this section, we'll set up the necessary components and create the Lambda function that retrieves top news stories and performs sentiment analysis using Amazon Comprehend. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we start building the Lambda function, you'll need to obtain an API key from the News API service. This key is essential for accessing the latest news stories. If you're unfamiliar with how to obtain and secure an API key, please refer to the corresponding course video.

1. Visit the [News API website](https://newsapi.org/) to obtain your API key.
2. Register with your email and receive your unique API key. It's worth noting that this service is free.

## Lambda Function Setup

We'll begin by creating the Lambda function using AWS Cloud9. Cloud9 provides a convenient development environment for our Lambda function.

1. Open AWS Cloud9 and create a new Lambda function. Name it "news-sentiment-analyzer" or any preferred name.

2. Choose the runtime for your Lambda function. We'll use Python for this project.

3. Automatically generate the execution role for your Lambda function. This role should have permissions to communicate with Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Comprehend. If you're unsure how to create such a role, refer to the relevant video in the course.

## Lambda Function Code

The Lambda function code is relatively short and straightforward. It accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Retrieves today's headlines from the News API using your API key.
2. Performs sentiment analysis on the news headlines using Amazon Comprehend.
3. Stores the news articles along with their sentiment in Amazon DynamoDB.
4. Optionally deletes older news entries based on sentiment.

To access the complete Lambda function code, you can find it in the provided resources section. We recommend following the code for a detailed understanding.

Please note that the API key for the News API is present in the code. In practice, it's crucial to secure this key and not expose it publicly.

Now that you've set up your Lambda function, you're ready to execute the code. In the next video, we'll explore the usage of the Amazon Comprehend service to analyze news sentiment.
