Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Start by creating a VPC with multiple subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs). This will ensure that if one AZ goes down, your application can continue running in another AZ. Also, create an Internet Gateway (IGW) and attach it to your VPC to allow access to the internet.
Create a load balancer: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that will distribute incoming traffic across multiple Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances running your application. Attach the ALB to the subnets in your VPC.
Launch EC2 instances: Launch multiple EC2 instances in different AZs and configure them with your web application. Make sure that your instances are in the same security group as your ALB.
Create a database: Create a Relational Database Service (RDS) instance in a different AZ from your EC2 instances. Configure it with your application database and make sure that your RDS instance is in the same security group as your EC2 instances.
Set up Auto Scaling: Use Auto Scaling to automatically launch or terminate EC2 instances based on traffic demands. This will help ensure that your application always has enough resources to handle incoming traffic.
Configure Elastic File System (EFS): Configure EFS to store files that are shared between EC2 instances. This will help ensure consistency and availability of your data.
Deploy your application: Finally, deploy your web application through GitHub by configuring your EC2 instances with a deployment script that pulls your code from your GitHub repository. Make sure to configure your GitHub repository with a webhook that triggers the deployment script whenever a new commit is made.
That's it! By following these steps, you should have a multi-tier high-availability architecture on AWS that can host your web application
