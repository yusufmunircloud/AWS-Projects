## Configuring PHP Application with S3 Image URL and RDS Endpoint

1. **Accessing Your Instances:**
   - Connect to one of your EC2 instances using SSH. You'll need to do this for both instances in different availability zones.

2. **Configuring the RDS Page:**
   - Edit the RDS.PHP page on your server.
   - Locate the connection string in the PHP code.
   - Update the following parameters:
     - Host: Replace with the RDS endpoint.
     - Username: Use the RDS master username (e.g., root).
     - Password: Enter the RDS master password.

3. **Configuring the S3 Image Page:**
   - Edit the S3 image.PHP page on your server.
   - Find the image URL in the HTML code.
   - Replace the placeholder with the URL of the image from your S3 bucket.
   
4. **Testing the Application:**
   - Exit the SSH session.
   - Access your application through its public IP address or Elastic IP.
   - Test the following pages:
     - S3 Image Page: Verify that the image from the S3 bucket is displayed correctly.
     - RDS Page: Confirm that the application connects to the RDS instance successfully.

5. **Repeat for the Second Instance:**
   - Make sure to repeat the above configuration steps for the second EC2 instance in the other availability zone.
   
By completing these steps, you'll configure your PHP application to work with the S3 image URL and connect to the RDS instance using the endpoint. Ensure that you make identical changes on both instances for fault tolerance and replication testing. Good luck with your task!
