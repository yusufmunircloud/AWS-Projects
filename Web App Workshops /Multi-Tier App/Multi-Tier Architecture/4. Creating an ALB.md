## Registering EC2 Instances with a Target Group for Load Balancer

In this video, we'll go through the steps of registering your EC2 instances with a target group for your load balancer. You should have two EC2 instances in different availability zones (e.g., 1a and 1b) for this task.
1. **Creating Load Balancer:**
   - Scroll down on the ec2 side section and find Load Balancers, then Click `Create Load Balancer`, and finally click create `Application Load Balancer`
   - Ensure that you have two EC2 instances in different availability zones (A and B).
   - Place your load balancer in the two AZs where your ec2 instances reside
   - Add a listener for HTTP on Port 80

2. **Access the Target Group:**
   - Navigate to your AWS console.
   - In the EC2 service, go to the "Target Groups" section.
   - Select your target group and click on the "Targets" tab.

3. **Register Instances:**
   - In the "Targets" tab, click the "Edit" button.
   - You will see a list of instances in different availability zones (e.g., 1a and 1b).
   - Select both instances by ticking the boxes.
   - Click the "Add to Register" button.
   - Don't forget to click the "Save" button to register the instances with the target group.

4. **Verify Target Health:**
   - Monitor the target health status in the "Targets" tab.
   - Wait for the status to change to "healthy" for both instances.

5. **Testing the Load Balancer:**
   - Copy the DNS name of your load balancer.
   - Access your application using the load balancer's DNS name. It should be {DNSNAME}/index.php
   - Test the application pages to verify that the load balancer distributes requests to the registered instances.
   - The Load Balancer will be using a Round-Robin configuration so everytime you refresh the page your request will be alternating between the servers.
By following these steps, you'll successfully register your EC2 instances with the target group, allowing the load balancer to distribute requests across the instances. Make sure to check the target health status before testing the load balancer. Good luck with this task!
