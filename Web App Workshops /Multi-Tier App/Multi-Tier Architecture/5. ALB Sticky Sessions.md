## Setting Up Sticky Sessions on a Load Balancer

In this video, we'll go through the process of configuring sticky sessions on a load balancer to address the issue of session continuity when load balancing requests across multiple servers. Sticky sessions ensure that a user's subsequent requests are directed to the same server where their initial session was created.

**Understanding the Problem:**
- Load balancers typically use round-robin distribution, which can result in a user's requests being sent to different servers.
- This can cause issues, especially for applications that rely on user sessions.

**Verification and Testing:**
1. Edit the session pages on both instances and add a server identifier, such as the instance ID or IP address, to the page.
2. Visit the session page through the load balancer.
3. Observe that the load balancer switches requests between the two servers in a round-robin fashion.
4. Submit a form on one of the servers to create a session.
5. Note that when refreshing the page, the load balancer directs the request to the other server where the session is not recognized. The user may be asked to log in again.

**Configuring Sticky Sessions:**
1. Access the load balancer's configuration in the AWS console.
2. Scroll down to the "Stickiness" attribute in the target group.
3. Edit the stickiness attribute and enable it.

**Testing Sticky Sessions:**
1. After enabling sticky sessions, revisit the session page through the load balancer.
2. Observe that the load balancer now consistently sends requests to the same server.
3. Confirm that the session created on one server remains accessible when refreshing the page.

**Considerations:**
- Session stickiness in the load balancer relies on its own cookie and doesn't directly interact with the application's session. Ensure your application's session settings match the load balancer's stickiness configuration for a seamless experience.

By following these steps, you can configure sticky sessions on a load balancer, which is crucial for applications relying on user sessions. Understanding how to configure and test session stickiness is essential for maintaining a consistent user experience in a load-balanced environment. Good luck with this task!
