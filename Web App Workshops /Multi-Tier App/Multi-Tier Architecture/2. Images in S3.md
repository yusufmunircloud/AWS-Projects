## How to Create an S3 Bucket and Make an Image Public

1. **Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
   - Click on "Create bucket."
   - Choose a unique name for your bucket (unique across all AWS users).
   - Select a region for your bucket.
   - Turn off `Block All Public Access` and Acknowledge it
   - Leave other settings as default and create the bucket.

3. **Upload an Image:**
   - Inside the newly created bucket, click on "Upload."
   - Choose the image file from your computer and upload it to the bucket.

4. **Make the Image Public:**
   - Select the uploaded image object within your bucket.
   - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
   - Scroll Down and Click To Edit the Bucket Policy
   - Then put this as the Bucket Policy, It only allows access to the specified object within the bucket:
```shell
hdfs dfs -ls /user/`whoami`
ls -ltr ~/data-engineering-on-gcp/data

hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /public
hdfs dfs -put ~/data-engineering-on-gcp/data/retail_db /public
hdfs dfs -ls -R /public/retail_db
hdfs dfs -rm -R -skipTrash /public/retail_db

gsutil list gs://airetail/retail_db
hdfs dfs -cp gs://airetail/retail_db /public
hdfs dfs -ls -R /public/retail_db
```

   - Save the changes.

5. **Verify Image Accessibility:**
   - After making the image public, you can access it via its URL.
   - In the object properties, you'll find the URL for the image.
   - Open the URL in your web browser to ensure that the image is accessible to the public.

This process centralizes your image storage in S3 and makes images accessible via their URLs. Later, you can configure your PHP application to use these URLs to display images served from S3. Good luck with your task!
