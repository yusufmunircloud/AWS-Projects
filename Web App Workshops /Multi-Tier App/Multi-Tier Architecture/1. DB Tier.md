# Launching and Connecting to RDS Instance

## Launching the RDS Instance

1. Start by ensuring that the RDS instance is launched in the same default VPC as your EC2 instance. This ensures they are in the same network.

2. Use the default security group to avoid network connectivity issues, as it's configured to allow connections from your network.

3. Choose MySQL as your database engine, as this application works with MySQL.

4. Opt for a multi-AZ deployment to enhance fault tolerance. RDS will automatically create a primary and a secondary server in different availability zones.

5. Configure the server size to "micro" for cost-saving. Although multi-AZ is not free tier eligible, you can remove the instance after practice.

6. Set the storage type to general purpose to reduce costs.

7. Give the instance a name, such as "PHP app RDS."

8. Specify the master username (root) and set up a secure password.

## Connecting to the RDS Instance

1. Once the RDS instance becomes available, you'll find a DNS endpoint. Use this endpoint to test connectivity from your EC2 instance to RDS.

2. SSH into your EC2 instance, which should be in the same VPC.

3. Use the MySQL client to initiate a MySQL connection using the following command:
   ```bash
   mysql -h <RDS endpoint> -u <master username> -p
