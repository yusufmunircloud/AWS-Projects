# Recovering from Availability Zone (AZ) Failure

**Instructor:** In this video, we'll learn how to recover from an availability zone (AZ) failure. When an AZ fails due to reasons like power supply problems or internet connection issues, it's crucial to recover in a healthy zone. Here's the recovery process:

## Recovery Steps

1. **Disassociate Elastic IP:** Start by disassociating the Elastic IP from the EC2 instance. This ensures the IP is available for the replacement.

2. **Clean Up:** Remove the EC2 instance and associated volumes from the failed zone to maintain a clean environment.

3. **Create Replacement Instance:** Launch a replacement instance in a healthy availability zone. Ensure the replacement instance is in a different zone from the failed one.

4. **Create New Data Volume:** Create a new data volume using a snapshot in the same healthy zone as the replacement instance.

5. **Attach Resources:** Attach the new data volume and re-associate the Elastic IP with the replacement server.

6. **Restart Server:** Restart the replacement server. This is essential for services like MySQL to work correctly.

7. **Verify Application:** After restarting, verify the application using the Elastic IP address.

Remember that the new data volume and replacement server must be in a different availability zone from the failed one for successful recovery.

Good luck with this task!
