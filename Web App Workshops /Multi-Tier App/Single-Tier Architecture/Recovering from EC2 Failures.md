# Recovering from Instance Failure

**Instructor:** In this video, we'll discuss how to recover from an instance failure. In this scenario, the EC2 instance has failed, but the EBS volume (especially the data volume) is intact, and the availability zone is unaffected.

## Recovery Steps

1. **Stop the Failed Instance:** Begin by stopping the failed instance.

2. **Detach Data Volume:** In the EC2 console, detach the data volume from the failed instance.

3. **Disassociate Elastic IP:** Disassociate the elastic IP address from the failed instance.

4. **Launch Replacement Server:** Launch a replacement server using an AMI in the same availability zone. This is crucial because the data volume can only be attached to a server in the same zone.

5. **Attach Data Volume:** Attach the data volume to the replacement server.

6. **Associate Elastic IP:** Associate the elastic IP address with the replacement server.

7. **Restart Server:** Restart the replacement server.

8. **Verify Application:** Use the local db.php page to verify that the recovery has been successful.

Ensure that you follow these steps in the correct order to recover from an instance failure.

Good luck with the recovery process!
