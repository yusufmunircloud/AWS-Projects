# Recovering from Data Volume Failure

**Instructor:** In this video, we'll learn how to recover from a data volume failure. Data loss is a significant concern in such scenarios, as snapshots are taken periodically, resulting in potential data loss. Let's see how to recover.

## Recovery Steps

1. **Stop the Server:** Begin by stopping the server with the failed data volume.

2. **Detach the Data Volume:** In the EC2 console, detach the failed data volume. Since it's unresponsive and no longer needed, you can remove it.

3. **Delete the Data Volume:** To keep things clean, you can delete the failed data volume.

4. **Restore Data:** Restore your data from a snapshot. Create a new EBS volume using the snapshot to recover your data.

5. **Attach the New Data Volume:** Attach the newly restored data volume to the EC2 instance.

6. **Restart the Server:** Restart the server after attaching the new data volume.

7. **Verify the Application:** To ensure a successful recovery, verify the application using the localdb.php page.

Make sure the new data volume is created in the same availability zone as your EC2 instance for successful attachment.

Good luck with the recovery process!
